**Custom Website** -> The code base is for implementing a custom web chatbot using the ineuron sitemap. We use Pinecone as vector db and Llama model for augmented generation.

Conversational AI for Codebase Exploration
Developed an interactive Q&A system to simplify understanding large codebases. The project clones a GitHub repository, processes Python files into structured chunks using LangChain, creates a searchable knowledge base with OpenAI embeddings stored in a Chroma vector database, and integrates a conversational interface using OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT and memory for context-aware responses. The system enables seamless querying of code insights, like understanding classes or methods, enhancing developer productivity.

Tech Stack: Python, Git, LangChain, OpenAI API, Chroma.
Highlights: Automated knowledge extraction, semantic search, and conversational AI for efficient codebase exploration.

The code is in trials.ipynb. 
We have the necessary template ready to modularize it later.
